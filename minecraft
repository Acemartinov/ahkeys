; Makes warping to different points extremely easy
;
; This is a very ergonomic solution as it alleviates your keyboard hand from 
; having to constantly switch between WASD and other keys such as forward slash.
; 
; I've complimented this with setting the individual warp names to letters and
; numbers accessible by your left "WASD" hand. For example, to go home I press
; the middle mouse button then "r" and the "back" button on my mouse. Extremely
; quick, and much more comfortable. The other mouse button is if you miss your
; desired key and want a more "neat" way of changing it.
